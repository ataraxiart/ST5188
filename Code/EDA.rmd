Let's perform exploratory data analysis on our dataset!

#### Changi
```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
#| include: FALSE

# this section is to pre-process CHANGI data
subzone = "CHANGI"

# extract, impute and combine data from images - swarnali + amira
df_changi <- combine_img(subzone) # takes around 3-4 mins
rownames(df_changi) <- NULL

# aggregate temporally and obtain final data - naomi
final_changi <- st_aggregate(df_changi, subzone) # long format is saved in Data/Final
```
